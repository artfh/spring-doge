## Building and running with Docker

You can use STS or a locally installation of maven to build spring-doge. However, if you need to build that on a new machine where you don't have all your development environment setup, you can build it with the maven Docker container.

```
docker run -v ~/.m2:/root/.m2 -v "$PWD":/usr/src -w /usr/src maven:3-jdk-8 mvn install
```

This will create the spring-doge jar file in target.
Then, you can build a container for the app and run the app and a Mongodb database in containers with the following commands:

```
docker build -t chanezon/spring-doge .
docker-compose up
```

Change chanezon to your docker hub username (change it also in the docker-compose.yml file) if you want to push a modification to this image to your repository in Docker hub.
